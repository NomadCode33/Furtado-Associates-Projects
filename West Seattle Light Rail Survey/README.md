# West Seattle Light Rail Survey
Write a short sentence or two about this project and what it does. Be sure to include a link and a screenshot (we're front end devs so we can actually see our work!).



## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Trimble S/VX Total Stations, Leica P50 LiDAR Scanner, Office Database, Printer

Disclaimer about the work policy and that I can't take work documents out, but I can still talk about it

Talk about how we do different types of projects liek infrastructure, CCTVs on swers and such, cutting down shurbs and greenery to get the data points that we need for a bunch of different clients and stakeholders.

First things first, we consulted with the field team in the office to give us guidance and pointers on what we need to do. Then we drive out to the location.

We set up the arms which allows us to mount up the equipment and measure and records data and attach the equipment on there adn we either start a new project or resume an existing project.

From here it branches off into two types of projects:
<br>
**Leica P50**
We either start or resume an exisitng project.
The project we were on was the West Seattle Light Rail project. The stakeholders/clients are SOund transit and they relied on us to measure out points for the Light Rail that is being developed there. The points we take help them out with their decision in the construction process. We went around the a good majority of West Seattle to record these points.

While we do that we set up the arms  and the control points that were previously installed on the ground. 

It intially starts off with two arms to intially travel and record the points accordingly. 

Then it goes to three arms with one arms representing the previous point, one showing the current point that it's on, and one that goes to the point where it will go next. 

While the measure the points are measured, I put them into the legal book which is a documentary of all the steps and rocesses taken. 

It's important to take notes in this document because if a court case is done they will look through it. 

After all the points and measurements are recorded and inputted, the Leica then scanned the area in a 360 degrees to scan everything into a 3D area as well as take pictures.

The process is then repeated until we captured all the ponts in the West Seattle area.

After we are done for teh day, we go back to the office.

We upload all the data into the office database with the correct file format which also included scanning the legal book and other documents so everyone can view data.


**Trimble S/VX Total Stations** <br>
We either start or resume an exisitng project.

The project we were on was the West Seattle Light Rail project. We use this device to scan everything in the area such as utilities like power boxes, curbsides, property lines, and anything you can think of on the street. This is used to have clients/stakehodler like SOund Transit to actively see what is in their surroundings so they don't encorach on proerty or even ruin important things like power boxes.

On the Trimble there is a device that is mounted with a tablet like computer to input poits, special glass that is mounted on a rod or arm that measures points. The Trimble allows us to measure more topgraphically to measure more things like elevation the way that the Leica P50 can't do on its own. We set up at least 2 arms, one for our reference point and one where we mount the Trimble deivce on the arm so it can lock on. The way it works is that the team captain uses the rod to go to the control points posted on the ground and the trimble device on the arm locks in automatically or manually by the user on the rod with the speciall glass to precise measure down the point.  On the tablet, I verify the settings and the point locks-in. There are specific measurements like offset for certain points that would translate well on the am, to make it right they use certain formulas to make it correct on the map. We also verifiy if the measurmeent forthe reference point we put down is okay periodically.

We repeat the process for the rest of the points until we go back to the office

We upload all the data into the office database with the correct file format which also included scanning the legal book and other documents so everyone can view data.

**CCTV**
This wasn't on the West Seattle Light Rail project but rather on other projects like the one I also worked on in Lynnwood. We use a long measuring stick, a protractor, mesuring tape, and other tools to have measurements of sewers and pipes. We go by each pipes located underground and also draw diagrams to show where they are located and know which ones are connected to where.

## Optimizations

I didn't exactly says this to the coworker I was working with but I found out a faster way of pointing out points.

I noticed that we included the points of the streets as we moved the arms in the area. I noted that it would be faster to have the Leica scan that points without going more into the streeet. It would've saved more time in the long run and make us more efficient.

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *wow I actually did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
