# West Seattle Light Rail Survey
Write a short sentence or two about this project and what it does. Be sure to include a link and a screenshot (we're front end devs so we can actually see our work!).



## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Trimble S/VX Total Stations, Leica P50 LiDAR Scanner, Office Database

Disclaimer about the work policy and that I can't take work documents out, but I can still talk about it

Talk about how we do different types of projects liek infrastructure, CCTVs on swers and such, cutting down shurbs and greenery to get the data points that we need for a bunch of different clients and stakeholders.

First things first, we consulted with the field team in the office to give us guidance and pointers on what we need to do. Then we drive out to the location.

We set up the arms and attach the equipment on there adn we either start a new project or resume an existing project.

From here it branches off into two types of projects:
Leica P50
We either start or resume an exisitng project











## Optimizations
*(optional)*

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *wow I actually did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
