# West Seattle Light Rail Survey
Write a short sentence or two about this project and what it does. Be sure to include a link and a screenshot (we're front end devs so we can actually see our work!).



## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Trimble S/VX Total Stations, Leica P50 LiDAR Scanner, Office Database, Printer

There is no document nor picture showing this project since Furtado & Associates has a policy of not keeping company property for personal use, which includes data. I can however can still talk about the work that was done and the process on how the products are made.

The Survey department spends time outside in the field collecting data points for clients/stakeholders for development projects on infrastructure and even on other types of projects lkike CCTVs on sewers and pipelines and even in forest areas and I have aken part in a decent amount of them.

First things first, before going outside we consulted with the field team in the office to give us guidance and pointers on what we need to do and general tips on how we should conduct surveys for that general area or project. Then we drive out to the location carrying our equipment to be used in the vehicle. We set up the arms which allows us to mount up the equipment and measure and records data and attach the equipment on there adn we either start a new project or resume an existing project. From here it branches off into two types of projects which use either the Leica P50 LiDAR Scanner or the Trimble S/VX Total Stations that generate 3D representations and topographical analysis in the Sound Transit West Seattle Light Rail project respectively.

### Leica P50 LiDAR Scanner
When we get to the project area, we either start or resume an exisitng project.
The project we were on was the West Seattle Light Rail project. The stakeholders/clients are Sound transit, they relied on us to measure out points for the Light Rail that is being developed there. The points we record helps them out with their decision in the construction process. We went around the a good majority of West Seattle to record these points.

The first step is setting up the arms over the control points that were previously installed on the ground on previous recon/surveying spot and installing the Leica P50 Scanner device on it. When starting or resumoing a project, it intially starts off with two arms with the current arm being the point we start off on and another arm to where it will travel to to junpstart our progression to travel and record the points accordingly. The second arm has a black and white target bullseye that is mounted on the arm, this target helps the Leica P50 focus on the next point, record it, and save it to be later used as the current position and ultimately helps with 3D construction. After the basic setup is finished, we then use three arms with one arm representing the previous point, one showing the current point that it's on, and one that goes to the point where it will go next. The previous point and future point has those same targets on them so that when the Leica P50 scans the points it provides the boundaries for how close or far the machine has to go when scanning the area in 3D.

During the process of measuring the points, I put them into the legal book which is a documentary of all the steps, processes taken, and most importantly recording all the points taken during our surveying venture. It's important to take notes in this document one because it can be used as reference to check and verify what the measurements were and two because if a court case is done and there is foul play or a mistake in measurement they will look through it as evidence. After all the points and measurements are recorded and inputted, the Leica then scanned the area in a 360 degrees to scan everything into a 3D area as well as take pictures. The process is then repeated until we captured all the ponts in the West Seattle area.

After we are done for the day, we go back to the office. We upload all the data into the office database with the correct file format which also included scanning the legal book and other documents so everyone can view data. These tools, including ArcGIS Pro and Autodesk Civil 3D are then used by other departments in Furtado & Associates, data was processed through an internal pipeline for cleaning and conversion before being delivered to clients. Once quality assurance is finished and everything is accurate and verified, it's later sent to SOund transit for further processing and cleaning. Eventually the data collected with be processed and cleaned and be sent out to the public for them to know the specifics of the new Light rail Station being built. This process helps both the public and project team understand survey results. 

### Trimble S/VX Total Stations
We either start or resume an exisitng project.

The project we were on was the West Seattle Light Rail project. We use this device to scan everything in the area such as utilities like power boxes, curbsides, property lines, and anything you can think of on the street. This is used to have clients/stakehodler like SOund Transit to actively see what is in their surroundings so they don't encorach on proerty or even ruin important things like power boxes.

On the Trimble there is a device that is mounted with a tablet like computer to input poits, special glass that is mounted on a rod or arm that measures points. The Trimble allows us to measure more topgraphically to measure more things like elevation the way that the Leica P50 can't do on its own. We set up at least 2 arms, one for our reference point and one where we mount the Trimble deivce on the arm so it can lock on. The way it works is that the team captain uses the rod to go to the control points posted on the ground and the trimble device on the arm locks in automatically or manually by the user on the rod with the speciall glass to precise measure down the point.  On the tablet, I verify the settings and the point locks-in. There are specific measurements like offset for certain points that would translate well on the am, to make it right they use certain formulas to make it correct on the map. We also verifiy if the measurmeent forthe reference point we put down is okay periodically.

We repeat the process for the rest of the points until we go back to the office

We upload all the data into the office database with the correct file format which also included scanning the legal book and other documents so everyone can view data.

**CCTV**
This wasn't on the West Seattle Light Rail project but rather on other projects like the one I also worked on in Lynnwood. We use a long measuring stick, a protractor, mesuring tape, and other tools to have measurements of sewers and pipes. We go by each pipes located underground and also draw diagrams to show where they are located and know which ones are connected to where.

## Optimizations

I didn't exactly says this to the coworker I was working with but I found out a faster way of pointing out points.

I noticed that we included the points of the streets as we moved the arms in the area. I noted that it would be faster to have the Leica scan that points without going more into the streeet. It would've saved more time in the long run and make us more efficient.

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *wow I actually did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
