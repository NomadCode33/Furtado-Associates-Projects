# Lynnwood QA/QC & Legal Document
Write a short sentence or two about this project and what it does. Be sure to include a link and a screenshot (we're front end devs so we can actually see our work!).

**Disclaimer:** Furtado & Associates maintains a policy of not allowing company property for personal use, so I don't have any documents or pictures of my project. However, I can describe the work I did and the process we followed.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Autodesk Civil 3D, Microsoft Word, Office Database, BlueBeam, Microsoft Teams

I do have a document of the steps done, but it won't as detailed as the boundary maps

Disclaimer about the work policy and that I can't take work documents out, but I can still talk about it

This department works together to get things done while hanfling land use permits, parcel maps, and quality checks. We often used Microsoft Teams to have meetings with each other and delve into the deadlines of the projects that we have to get done.

I then jump into Autodesk Civil 3D and teh document on the parcel map from Lynnwood. I perform QA/QC on the parcel document comparing it to the original map source. I verified buulding measurements, if the xoning proeprry lines are correct, fee codes up to date, easements are correct, as well as building dimensions being correct and accurate. For building dimensions, i often go to the county website to find them and vrfiy them myself on based off the parcel and proerty information. I also looks for errors on the parcel map document itself to see of the legend icons are correct snd everything on the map lines up properly. After findings all the errors, I then comment/annotate al the errors to have the people that made the document to make changes accordingly. 

I also learned how to make legal documents as well. I used the information from the website regarding property information into the doucment and cited my sources, and other legal information that is important for the construction of buildings. Lastly, using the information from the parcel map aboutthe buulding being presented. I learned linear referencing using North, SOuth, East, and West and degrees to pinpoint building landmarks for development in the eyes of the development crew for the stakeholder. Through this, I presented technical and non-technical information to technical and non-technical audiences in a rpofessional setting.

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *wow I actually did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
