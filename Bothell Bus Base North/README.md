Write a short sentence or two about this project and what it does. Be sure to include a link and a screenshot (we're front end devs so we can actually see our work!).

**Disclaimer:** Furtado & Associates maintains a policy of not allowing company property for personal use, so I don't have any documents or pictures of my project. However, I can describe the work I did and the process we followed.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Autodesk Civil 3D, Microsoft Excel, BlueBeam, Office Database


I opened up Autodesk Civil 3D to set up the workspace. I added lisp routines and ran through common CAD commands to familiarize myself with the software. This also invloved learning standards, styles, and naming conventions. I was also familiarized with the folder strucutre of the office database and th esupporting data in the arious formats and using those different programs like BlueBeam, Excel, Monday.com, etc.

got the data from the office database and 

From there I set up the map scene with the correct settings before adding the data

I added in the data, but I first copied the points and moved it away from the orignal. This is meant to change the data proeprties so the COGO names, symbols are taken out, and everything else is properly optimized and primed before moving the data back. I moved the data back to original spot and removed ay duplicates remaining.

I used Microsoft Excel to view the code names and followed the directions on what I should do. Code names provide different steps of what I need to such as adding it a label, deleting something from the symbol, adding in symbols or putting the correct symbol, and much more. I repeated the process until I completed the entire project.

I also constructed a 3D polygon creek, it was very intesnive involving to go off of certain points.




Synchronized point clouds with real-world geospatial data to enhance 3D linework and COGO points, ensuring spatial data accuracy and authenticity for demographic analysis using Autodesk Civil 3D. Field data was also processed to integrate linework and symbology for various features, such as landmarks, roads, structures, and utilities.

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *wow I actually did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
